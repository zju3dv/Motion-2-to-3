We present Motion-2-to-3, a framework that leverages 2D motion data to enhance 3D motion generation.

First, we present a series of comparisons with baseline methods to demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

Compared to our method, MDM results are less active and lively, lacking natural dynamics.

MLD fails to generate correct motions.

MotionCLIP generates unrealistic results, failing to align with natural human movements.

MDM generates the wrong type of motion.

MLD generates strange and unnatural motions.

MotionCLIP produces unnatural results.

Unlike our method, MDM fails to generate successful standing-up motions.

Similarly, MLD also fails to generate standing-up motions.

MotionCLIP generates very strange and unrealistic results.

In the following section, we compare different strategies for leveraging 2D motion data.

MAS generates unnatural results due to inconsistencies in multi-view 2D motions, whereas our method ensures consistency and realism.

MotionBERT fails to capture global movements, resulting in unrealistic motions compared to our method.

The 2D condition model exhibits strange turning motions. 

MAS lacks global movements, limiting its ability to generate realistic and dynamic 3D motions.

Similarly, MotionBERT struggles to produce global movements.

The 2D condition model generates incorrect global movements.

Next, we present the ablation study, analyzing the impact of different components in our method.

Without pretraining, the model generates unnatural and strange poses.

With consistency block, the model produces incorrect walking directions and insufficient turning motions.

With only three views, the model generates incorrect walking motions.

Without pretraining, the model generates strange poses.

With consistency block, the model does not turn around sufficiently.

With five views, the model produces worse turning motions.

Finally, we present more results.

Our method successfully generates realistic in-distribution motions, such as walking and crawling.

Additionally, it synthesizes natural out-of-distribution motions, including juggling a soccer ball and playing tennis.
